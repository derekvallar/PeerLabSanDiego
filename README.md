# Peer Lab Community: San Diego

The [Peer Lab Community](https://peerlab.community/) was created to help developers find collaborative working spaces around the world. If you're hoping to grind down on some coding projects or looking for help with some development questions then feel free to stop by for an hour or two. Developers of any experience/coding languages are welcome!

## Meetups
Time: **Every Thursday, 4-6pm** (unless stated here otherwise)

Location: **Copa Vida, 11055 Roselle St, San Diego, CA 92121**

## Organizer

My name is **Derek Vallar**. I'm a "recent" computer engineering grad pursuing mobile development. I've been slowly learning iOS development for over a year now so I'm mostly knowledgable in Swift. I can primarily help others in that area, but I'd love to help out with any other fields. If you stop by, look for a grey-backed macbook with a whale sticker on it!

If you have any questions:

- Message me: derekvallar@gmail.com
- Create an issue in this repository
